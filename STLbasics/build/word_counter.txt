One of the fundamental challenges of business process automation, in general, is how to 
efficiently extract data from semi-structured or unstructured sources, such as PDF files, and use 
that data to automatically perform data entry on other systems, with little or no need for human 
intervention. 
This is what we are going to explore in this chapter. We are going to create a Python script that 
can read PDF form documents, extract specific data from them, and automatically fill in the 
same data on a web-based system.
