Understanding Complexity

To characterize problems in terms of complexity, it's essential to study data and compute dimensions more in-depth.
Data Dimensions

    Volume: Expected size of data that the algorithm will process.
    Velocity: Rate of new data generation (can be zero).
    Variety: Number of different types of data the algorithm will process.

Compute Dimensions

    Multi-node parallel architecture
    GPUs
    TPUs

Complexity

    Modern in-memory data structures used in distributed computing require efficient resources.
    In most cases, algorithms are iterative. There are three types:
        Converging Iterations
        Diverging Iterations
        Flat Iterations
